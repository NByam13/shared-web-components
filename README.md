# Shared Web Components
A proof of concept project that intends to build 
components that can leverage API data and be built and served to use in other frameworks.

The main target for this use case is wordpress, to create components that can be used via plugin.

This repo will contain both the code for the data widgets, as well as the wordpress plugin code.
